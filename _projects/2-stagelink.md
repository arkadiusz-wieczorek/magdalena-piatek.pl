Last summer I've worked on ux research at Stagelink in Berlin.


About project: Stagelink, the fan-powered tour promoter, crowdsources live events for Internet stars, leveraging millions of online followers to create successful shows and tours for 21st century artists. On stagelink.com, artists and managers track fan-driven, real-time demand to plan, pre-finance, and de-risk tours, while reaching highly engaged audiences.
