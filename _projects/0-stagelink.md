Last summer I've worked on UX research at Stagelink startup in Berlin. During my 3-month work I've developed test scenarios and I've conducted audits and usability tests with real web application on mobile for 9 users. I've analyzed real user behavior to improve features of stagelink application. I carried out the survey for rating usability of stagelink application and competitive services. At the end of my work I prepared 37-page report containing: description of tests, study the needs of stagelink's users, strengths and weaknesses of application and recommendations aimed at improving product.
